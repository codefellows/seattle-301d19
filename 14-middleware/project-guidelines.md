# Friday Project Guidelines

Wireframe for your single-page web app

The API that you intend to use

At least two models (e.g. constructor function & database table) that you intend to create

Navigation between at least 3 different views, NOT including the "about" page

* Have an idea of your git workflow:
  - Your branch structure (e.g. master, staging, dev, feature branches)
  - How often you intend to have merge parties (no longer than 1 hour without a merge party)
  - How you intend to divide up work
  - How you intend to track what work needs to be done (github issues, waffle.io, trello, whatever)

* Other things you should maybe consider
  - Any external libraries you may need to use and get familiar with (Google Maps, express request proxy, etc.)
  - What templates you might want to write
  - Whether to pair/group program or solo (or some combination)
  - What stretch goals you're interested in
  - Use a CDN when you can
  - Have a deployment by Monday at noon
